Let's Start 👇👇



🐞 The Vulnerability:

📌 The implementation contract can initialize the _controller address multiple times on Managed contract even though it should only be allowed once.

📌 This means a compromised implementation can reinitialize the contract above and become the owner to complete the privilege escalation then drain the user's fund.


💡Recommended Mitigation Steps:
Use the initializer modifier to protect the function from being reinitiated

⚡How can you look for these types of bugs?
Always check if initialize function has initializer modifier to prevent function from being called more than once.
