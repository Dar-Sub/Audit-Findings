🔎 Audit Finding: Usage of deprecated ChainLink API
🎯 Project Name: Gro
🔥 Severity: Medium
🛡️ Auditor: @Code4rena

Let's Start 👇👇


🐞 The Vulnerability:

📌 According to Chainlink's documentation, the latestAnswer function is deprecated. The contracts of Gro protocol were using Chainlink’s deprecated API latestAnswer().

📌 Such functions might suddenly stop working if Chainlink stopped supporting deprecated APIs.

📌 If the Deprecated API stops working, Prices cannot be obtained and protocol stops and contracts have to be redeployed.



💡Recommended Mitigation Steps:
Use the latestRoundData function to get the price instead.
