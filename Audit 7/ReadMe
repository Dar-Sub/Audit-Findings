🔎 Audit Finding: Insufficient validation of Chainlink Oracle data feed
🎯 Project Name: Sentiment
🔥 Severity: Medium
🛡️ Auditor: Sherlock

Let's Start 👇👇


🐞 The Vulnerability:

📌 When fetching prices from latestRoundData, there is not enough validation that ensures the price returned is not stale.

📌 The getPrice function fetches oracle price from Chainlink using latestRoundData, there only exists one check to make sure the reported price is not a negative value

📌 As prices can never be a negative value, this check is not needed. Instead, there should be sufficient checks to make sure Chainlink's reported price feed is fresh and not stale.


💡Recommended Mitigation Steps:
Validate data feed by:
> Checking the returned answer is not 0.
> Verify result is within an allowed margin of freshness by checking updatedAt.
> Verify answer is indeed for the last known round.
