🔎 Audit Finding: Cannot unpause exchange
🎯 Project Name: 1Inch Exchange
🔥 Severity: Medium
🛡️ Auditor: Openzeppelin

Let's Start 👇👇


🐞 The Vulnerability:

📌 The OneInchExchange.sol contract exposes a mechanism for the owner to pause the contract. This disables the swap functionality.

📌 But the problem is that there is no corresponding mechanism to unpause the contract. This can be problematic and can shutdown the swap functionality permanently.


💡Recommended Mitigation Steps:
Consider introducing a mechanism for the owner to unpause the contract. if the current behavior is expected, consider renaming the pause function to shutdown.
