🔎 Audit Finding: A Typo leading to a locking of Funds
🎯 Project Name: Insure
🔥 Severity: High
🛡️ Auditor: @Code4rena

Let's Start 👇👇

🐞 The Vulnerability:

📌 In Solidity, "==" checks if the value of two operands are equal or not. And "=" is used to set a certain value to variables.

📌 In PoolTemplate Contract, The unlock() function has a typo where it uses "==" rather than "=". So, instead of setting the insurances[_id].status to false, it compares it to false.

📌 Now, If a user calls unlock() multiple times, insurances[_id].amount will be subtracted multiple times. It will result in 'lockedAmount' being way smaller.


💡Recommended Mitigation Steps:
Change "insurances[_id].status == false;" to "insurances[_id].status = false;"
