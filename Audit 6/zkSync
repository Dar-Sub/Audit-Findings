🔎 Audit Finding: BLOCK_PERIOD is incorrectly hardcoded.
🎯 Project Name: zkSync
🔥 Severity: Medium
🛡️ Auditor: Code4rena

Let's Start 👇👇Ethereum


🐞 The Vulnerability:

📌 In config.sol of zkSync contracts, The BLOCK_PERIOD is set to 13 seconds in Config.sol.

📌Ethereum Since moving to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) after the Merge, block times on ethereum are fixed at 12 seconds per block (slots).

📌 This results in an incorrect calculation of PRIORITY_EXPIRATION which is used to determine when a transaction in the priority Queue should be considered expired.

📌 By using a block time of 13 sec, a txn in the Priority Queue expires 5.5 hours earlier than expected.

💡Recommended Mitigation Steps:
Change the block period to 12 seconds
