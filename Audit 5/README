🔎 Audit Finding: Use safeCast for changing types
🎯 Project Name: Notional Coop
🔥 Severity: Medium
🛡️ Auditor: @ridwan

Let's Start 👇👇

🐞 The Vulnerability:

📌 In the NotionalTradeModule contract, the _mint function takes an argument "_fCashAmount" of type uint256. Now, in the function, the value of _fCashAmount is downcasted to uint88.

📌SafeMath and Solidity 0.8.* handles overflows for basic math operations but not for casting.

📌 If value that is greater than uint88 is passed for "_fCashAmount" into the _mint function, downcasting it to uint88 will silently overflow.

💡Recommended Mitigation Steps:
Consider using OpenZeppelin's SafeCast library to prevent unexpected overflows when casting from uint256.

⚡How can you look for these types of bugs?
Check if the contract uses safeCast Library for downcasting or not. If not check if the parameter is user controlled.
