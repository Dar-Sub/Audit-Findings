🔎 Exploit Finding: Bad Source of Randomness
🎯 Project Name: LuckeyTiger NFT
🔥 Severity: Critical

Let's Start 👇👇


🐞 The Vulnerability:

📌 In LuckyTigerNFT's Contract, _getRandom function is used to generate random numbers, which is called in the mint function while minting NFT.

📌The _getRandom function is using block.difficulty and block.timestamp for generating random numbers.

📌Now, Due to bad randomness we can predict it and mint the NFT Infinite times.


💡Recommended Mitigation Steps:
Use Chainlink VRF to generate random numbers.
